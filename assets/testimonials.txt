“I had discomfort in my rotator cuff.  Kristen was able to identify
 just the right spots.  Afterwards I felt so much better and had a much
 larger range of motion.  I was impressed that she could find just
 the right spot and then work through those muscles.  Such a relief.
-Suzanne W.

“I have been going to Kristen for at least a year. 
 She always adds a new wrinkle to my 90 minute massage sessions
 and this one was no different.  I was very stressed out when
 I arrived and unbelieveably relaxed when I left.  She is totally awesome.”
-George H.

“Kristen C. doesn’t go through a ‘mindless routine,’
 which has been my experience with some other therapists,
 but pays attention to what happens to be going on with
 my muscles on that particular day.  The massage she gives always
 is tailored to me, the client.  She has a nice friendly, professional manner,
 never over-chatty or intrusive, never bored or distant.  She works on
 my trigger points and always asks for my feedback on the amount of
 pressure that is comfortable for me.  She’s never “pokey,” rough, tentative,
 or ineffectual, but gives a very confident therapeutic massage.”
-Diana L.

“She focuses on her experienced touch of her hands to tell which muscles
 need more attention.  She is a true professional.”
-Larry F.
