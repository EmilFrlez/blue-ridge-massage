              <p>&ldquo;Massages for most people are very personal experiences.
			  Without a doubt Shawnda, one of the owners of Blue Ridge Massage,
			  brings home that fact by being both highly skilled and very personable.
              After having been in quite a few therapeutic massage centers over the years,
              when given the opportunity to have her work with my many aches and pains
              I have made the extra effort to check her availability. With my own preference
              for deep muscle technique her strong hands invariably finds the usual anatomical suspects.
              Equally adept at Swedish as well as many others I understand. 
              Often she is booked far ahead so one needs to reserve early!

I had discomfort in my rotator cuff.  Kristen was able to identify
 just the right spots.  Afterwards I felt so much better and had a much
 larger range of motion.  I was impressed that she could find just
 the right spot and then work through those muscles.  Such a relief.

 Kristen doesn&rsquo;t go through a &lsquo;mindless routine&rsquo;,
 which has been my experience with some other therapists,
 but pays attention to what happens to be going on with
 my muscles on that particular day.  The massage she gives always
 is tailored to me, the client.  She has a nice friendly, professional manner,
 never over-chatty or intrusive, never bored or distant.  She works on
 my trigger points and always asks for my feedback on the amount of
 pressure that is comfortable for me.  She&rsquo;s never &ldquo;pokey&rdquo;,
 rough, tentative, or ineffectual, but gives a very confident therapeutic massage.
